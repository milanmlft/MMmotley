This package contains various, not necessarily related, functions to make some data analysis tasks a little easier.

Why "motley"? Because "misc" or "miscellaneous" is already used [too often](https://github.com/search?q=misc+language%3AR&type=Repositories), so I went looking for a [synonym](https://www.lexico.com/synonym/miscellaneous).

## Installation

You can install MMmotley from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("milanmlft/MMmotley")
```
