\title{Create p-value histogram}
\usage{
gg_pval_hist(p_values, binwidth = 0.05)

geom_pval_hist(mapping = NULL, ..., binwidth = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_values}{Vector of p-values.}

\item{binwidth}{Binwidth of the histogram. A sensible choice is to use the
significance cut-off so that the height of the first bar
corresponds to the number of significant cases.
Default: 0.05.}

\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data}}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}
    \item{\code{position}}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}
    \item{\code{na.rm}}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}
    \item{\code{show.legend}}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}
    \item{\code{inherit.aes}}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}
    \item{\code{bins}}{Number of bins. Overridden by \code{binwidth}. Defaults to 30.}
    \item{\code{orientation}}{The orientation of the layer. The default (\code{NA})
automatically determines the orientation from the aesthetic mapping. In the
rare event that this fails it can be given explicitly by setting \code{orientation}
to either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}. See the \emph{Orientation} section for more detail.}
    \item{\code{stat}}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_histogram()}/\code{geom_freqpoly()} and \code{stat_bin()}.}

\description{
Use \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram()}} to create a histogram of p-values but with
better binwidths and axis limits.
}
\details{
By default, \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram()}} centers the first and last bins of
the histogram on the x-axis lower and upper limits, respectively.
In case of p-values, which lie in the interval [0, 1], it makes more
sense to set the boundaries of the first and last bins at 0 and 1.
The binwidths are also set at 0.05, commonly used as a cut-off for significance,
so that the height of the first bar represents the number of p-values lying
between 0 and 0.05, i.e. the number of cases that would be deemed significant.

\examples{
pvals <- runif(n = 1000, min = 0, max = 1)
gg_pval_hist(pvals)

## Using a data.frame in combination with `ggplot`
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(pvalue = runif(1000))
ggplot(df, aes(pvalue)) + geom_pval_hist()
