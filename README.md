This package contains various, not necessarily related, functions to
make some data analysis tasks a little easier.

Why “motley”? Because “misc” or “miscellaneous” is already used [too
often](https://github.com/search?q=misc+language%3AR&type=Repositories),
so I went looking for a
[synonym](https://www.lexico.com/synonym/miscellaneous).

Also, this is more like an enducational sandbox for myself to learn more
about R package development and everything related to that.

## Installation

You can install MMmotley from
[GitHub](https://github.com/milanmlft/MMmotley) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("milanmlft/MMmotley")
```
